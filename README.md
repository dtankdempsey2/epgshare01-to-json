# 🧰 Custom EPGShare01 Builder: Slim Down Your EPGs, Speed Up Your App!

Build a **personalized, lightweight EPG** using only the channels from your M3U playlist — optimized for performance and speed.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- ✅ Accepts your M3U playlist URL  
- 🔍 Extracts all `tvg-id` values  
- 🧹 Filters the giant [EPGShare01](https://epgshare01.online/) dataset to **only your channels**  
- 📦 Returns a compact, gzipped `epg.xml.gz` file

---

## 🤔 Why Use This?

**The Problem:**  
The full EPGShare01 file is **175+ MB**, bloated with 100,000+ channels — it slows down most IPTV apps.

**The Fix:**  
This script gives you a **5–20 MB** EPG tailored to *just* your playlist — making your app load faster and work better across devices.

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Lightning-fast EPG loading  
- 💾 Saves storage space  
- 🚀 Faster app performance  
- 📱 Perfect for mobile and low-powered devices

## 🚀 Usage

After deploying your own instance, use this URL format:

> https://your-project.vercel.app/api/epg?playlist=YOUR_PLAYLIST_URL

🔐 **Note:** Be sure to **URL-encode** your playlist link.

**Example:**

> https://your-project.vercel.app/api/epg?playlist=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fyourusername%2Frepo%2Fmain%2Fplaylist.m3u8

The result will be a gzipped EPG file ready to plug into your IPTV player:  
➡️ `epg.xml.gz`
